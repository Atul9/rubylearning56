Exercise 4
Write a Ruby program that tells you how many minutes there are in a year (do not bother right now about leap years etc.).
=end
minutes_per_hour = 60
hours_per_day = 24
days_per_year = 365
minutes_in_year = minutes_per_hour * hours_per_day * days_per_year
puts "There are #{minutes_in_year} minutes in a year."
